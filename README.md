ReelDiscovery generates realistic corporate email datasets for e-discovery training, testing, and demonstration purposes. Using OpenAI's GPT models, it creates authentic-feeling email threads based on movies, TV shows, books, or custom business scenarios.

## Features

### Email Generation
- **Storyline-driven content** - Emails follow coherent narratives with beginnings, middles, and conclusions
- **Character personalities** - Each character has a unique voice, writing style, and email signature
- **Realistic threading** - Proper email threading with Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers
- **Variable email lengths** - From quick one-line replies to detailed multi-paragraph messages
- **Branching conversations** - Side threads, forwards, and CC'd participants

### Attachments
- **Word Documents (.docx)** - Reports, memos, proposals with organization branding
- **Excel Spreadsheets (.xlsx)** - Data tables, budgets, tracking sheets
- **PowerPoint Presentations (.pptx)** - Slide decks with themed colors and fonts
- **Document versioning** - Realistic version chains (v1, v2_revised, v3_FINAL, etc.)

### AI-Generated Images (DALL-E)
- **Inline images** - Photos embedded directly in email body
- **Image attachments** - Photos, screenshots, visual evidence
- **Context-aware** - Images match the storyline and universe

### Voicemails (Text-to-Speech)
- **MP3 audio files** - Realistic voicemail recordings
- **Character voices** - Different TTS voices for each character
- **Natural speech** - Includes conversational elements like "um", pauses

### Calendar Invites
- **Auto-detection** - Finds meeting references in email content
- **.ics files** - Standard calendar format compatible with Outlook, Gmail, etc.
- **Attendee lists** - Pulls participants from email recipients

### Organization Theming
- **Per-domain branding** - Each organization gets unique colors and fonts
- **AI-selected themes** - Colors match the organization's character (law firms get formal navy, tech startups get vibrant colors)
- **Consistent styling** - Documents from the same organization share branding
