Generate characters with believable names, email addresses, and roles that fit the given topic.

CRITICAL RULE - STAY ON TOPIC:
If the topic is a specific movie, TV show, book, or other media property:
- You MUST ONLY use characters from THAT SPECIFIC property
- NEVER mix characters from different shows/movies (e.g., NO Parks and Rec characters in an Office dataset)
- Use the ACTUAL organization/company name from that source material
- Use the ACTUAL character names from that source material
- The email domain MUST match the canonical organization

Examples of CORRECT behavior:
- Topic 'The Office' → ONLY Dunder Mifflin characters (Michael Scott, Jim Halpert, Pam Beesly, Dwight Schrute, etc.) with dundermifflin.com
- Topic 'Parks and Recreation' → ONLY Pawnee Parks Dept characters (Leslie Knope, Ron Swanson, etc.) with pawnee.gov
- Topic 'Mad Men' → ONLY Sterling Cooper characters with sterlingcooper.com

Examples of WRONG behavior:
- Topic 'The Office' → Including Leslie Knope or Ron Swanson (WRONG - those are Parks and Rec characters!)
- Mixing ANY characters between different TV shows, movies, or books

For original/custom topics, create fitting fictional characters and company domain.

IMPORTANT: Create a realistic mix of internal and external contacts:
- Internal employees at the primary organization (from the source material)
- External contacts (customers, vendors, lawyers, consultants) with their OWN separate email domains
- External characters can be fictional, but internal characters MUST be from the source material

CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS AND EMOTIONAL DYNAMICS - CRITICAL:
The personalityNotes field MUST include relationship dynamics with other characters:
- Who are their ALLIES? (friends, mentors, collaborators they genuinely like)
- Who are their RIVALS or ENEMIES? (competitors, adversaries, people they distrust or despise)
- What TENSIONS exist? (grudges, jealousy, resentment, power struggles, old wounds)
- What makes them ANGRY? What triggers emotional reactions?
- How do they TRULY feel about the people they work with?

Examples of GOOD personalityNotes (emotionally rich):
- 'Sarcastic and deadpan. Close friends with Pam - they share inside jokes. Openly mocks and pranks Dwight, viewing him as insufferable. Resents Michael's incompetence but feels guilty about it. Secretly ambitious but hides it behind irony.'
- 'Intensely loyal to Michael, sees Jim as a direct threat to everything he's worked for. Aggressive and condescending with subordinates, submissive with authority figures. Holds grudges for years. Seethes with resentment when overlooked.'
- 'Calculating and ruthless behind a polished exterior. Views colleagues as pawns to be used. Despises weakness and sentimentality. Will sabotage rivals while maintaining plausible deniability. Enjoys watching others fail.'
- 'Warm but with a temper when pushed. Protective of friends, hostile to outsiders. Still bitter about being passed over for promotion. Distrusts management. Will get passive-aggressive when feeling disrespected.'

Examples of BAD personalityNotes (too bland - DO NOT DO THIS):
- 'Professional and organized. Good communicator.'
- 'Friendly and helpful team player.'
- 'Experienced manager with strong leadership skills.'

Storylines that need characters (use the index numbers to assign characters):
{storylinesSummary}
{existingNamesNote}{companyNote}{focusNote}
Generate exactly {characterCount} NEW characters who would be involved in these storylines. Include:

INTERNAL CHARACTERS ({internalCount}):
- A mix of management and staff levels at the primary organization
- Different departments as appropriate
- Use the primary company domain for all internal employees

EXTERNAL CHARACTERS ({externalCount}):
- Each external character should have a UNIQUE email domain from a DIFFERENT organization
- Use diverse, realistic external domains such as:
  * Law firms: harrisonlegal.com, whitfieldlaw.com, kmattorneys.com
  * Consulting: strategypartners.com, deloitte.com, mckinsey.com
  * Vendors/suppliers: officesupplyco.com, techsolutions.net, globalshipping.com
  * Customers/clients: acmecorp.com, horizonmedia.com, nationalretail.com
  * Banks/finance: firstnational.com, capitalinvest.com
  * Government/regulatory: state.gov, compliance-board.org
  * Personal emails for informal contacts: gmail.com, yahoo.com, outlook.com
- IMPORTANT: External characters should NOT all share the same domain - each external company/person should have their own unique domain
- Create realistic company names that match the domains

For each character, specify which storyline indices (0-based) they are involved in.

CRITICAL - STAY ON TOPIC:
- If this is a known TV show, movie, book, or other media, you MUST use ONLY characters from THAT SPECIFIC source
- DO NOT mix characters from different properties (e.g., NO Parks and Rec characters in The Office dataset!)
- For 'The Office': ONLY use Dunder Mifflin characters (Michael Scott, Jim Halpert, Pam Beesly, Dwight Schrute, Angela Martin, Kevin Malone, Oscar Martinez, Stanley Hudson, Phyllis Vance, etc.)
- Use the REAL company/organization domain (e.g., for 'The Office': dundermifflin.com)
- External contacts can be fictional (customers, vendors, corporate contacts from other companies)

SIGNATURE BLOCKS:
- All characters from corporate/organizational domains MUST have a professional email signature block
- Signature blocks should be consistent for all employees of the same organization
- Include: name, title, organization, phone (fictional), and optionally address or tagline
- Personal email domains (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.) may have simple or no signatures

PERSONALITY NOTES - MAKE THEM EMOTIONALLY RICH:
- DO NOT write bland descriptions like 'professional and organized'
- INCLUDE who they like, who they dislike, who they resent
- INCLUDE what triggers them emotionally
- INCLUDE their real attitudes toward colleagues (not just job function)
- Think about the SOURCE MATERIAL - how do these characters ACTUALLY interact?
