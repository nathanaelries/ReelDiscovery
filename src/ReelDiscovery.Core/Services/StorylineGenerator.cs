You will be given a topic (movie, TV show, book, or other subject) and must create storylines that:
1. Stay TRUE to the original fictional universe - if it's Game of Thrones, the emails are between characters IN Westeros discussing dragons, politics, battles, and intrigue
2. Reference ACTUAL events, plot points, characters, and conflicts from the source material
3. Capture the authentic tone, drama, and stakes of the original work
4. Feel like communications that would actually happen within that fictional world

For example:
- Game of Thrones: Ravens/messages between houses about alliances, betrayals, battles, and the threat beyond the Wall
- Star Wars: Imperial memos, Rebel communications, Jedi Council discussions
- The Office: Actual Dunder Mifflin emails about paper sales, office drama, and Michael's management disasters
- Breaking Bad: Texts and emails about the meth operation, DEA concerns, and cartel dealings

The emails should feel AUTHENTIC to the source material's world, not like a corporate translation of it.

EMOTIONAL INTENSITY IS CRITICAL:
Every storyline MUST have real emotional stakes and interpersonal conflict:
- What's the CONFLICT? Who is fighting, disagreeing, or clashing?
- What EMOTIONS drive the exchanges? (anger, fear, betrayal, desperation, jealousy, grief, contempt)
- Are there VILLAINS, antagonists, or people being blamed?
- Will tempers flare? Will characters say things they shouldn't?
- Are there SIDES being taken? People turning against each other?

The description field MUST specify:
1. The core conflict/tension
2. Which characters are in opposition
3. The emotional tone (heated, tense, bitter, desperate, accusatory, etc.)

DO NOT create bland, cordial storylines:
- BAD: 'Planning the company picnic' (boring, no conflict)
- GOOD: 'Company picnic disaster - food poisoning blamed on Angela, accusations of deliberate sabotage, HR gets involved'
- BAD: 'Quarterly budget review' (routine, no stakes)
- GOOD: 'Quarterly budget exposes missing funds - accusations fly between departments, someone's getting fired'

Always respond with valid JSON matching the specified schema exactly.";

{existingTitlesNote}{mediaHints}

Generate exactly {storylineCount} storylines set WITHIN the fictional universe of ""{topic}"", based on ACTUAL EVENTS and PLOT POINTS from the source material.

IMPORTANT: Each storyline must:
1. Be DIRECTLY BASED ON a specific event, plot point, or story arc from the source material
2. Stay IN-UNIVERSE - don't translate to a corporate setting, keep the original fictional context
3. Capture the authentic drama, stakes, and tone of the original work
4. Use titles that reference the actual events (e.g., for Game of Thrones: ""The Red Wedding Aftermath"", ""Wildfire Explosion at the Sept"", ""Dragons Missing from Dragonpit"")

The storylines should feel like they're happening INSIDE the fictional world:
- Game of Thrones: Political intrigue, battle planning, betrayals, supernatural threats
- Star Wars: Rebellion operations, Imperial orders, Jedi matters, trade negotiations
- Breaking Bad: Drug operation logistics, DEA investigations, cartel dealings
- The Office: Actual paper company dysfunction, Michael's disasters, office romance drama

Each storyline should:
1. Naturally generate email/message threads that characters in that world would send
2. Have a clear beginning, middle, and potential resolution
3. Involve 2-6 characters FROM the source material
4. Span a realistic timeframe for that story's events{dateRangeInstruction}

CRITICAL - MAKE STORYLINES EMOTIONALLY CHARGED:
- Every storyline needs CONFLICT and TENSION between characters
- The description MUST name who is in conflict with whom
- Include the EMOTIONAL STAKES (fear, anger, betrayal, desperation, jealousy)
- Characters who are enemies/rivals should CLASH in email threads
- Don't make everyone professional and cordial - let real emotions show

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
